We have two kinds of content that gets posted to the changelog portion of the site:

*   Automatic release notes for every major/minor version (these will come directly from a script I'm going to run against ClickUp), and,
    
*   Occasional updates regarding the docs site, such as a new tutorial, or new language available, or something else.
    

For automatic release notes, we create a directory in `ðŸ“„ changelog` matching the syntax `x.y.z`, where the letters represent the major / minor notation of the version. This makes easy permalinks.

For blog posts that have no assets (images, downloads, whatever) create a new file in `ðŸ“„ changelog` in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-title-slug.mdx` following the example of `ðŸ“„ changelog/2021-10-29-Welcome.mdx`like so:

<br/>

Here, `slug`[<sup id="zCbYL">â†“</sup>](#f-zCbYL) ultimately sets the URL slug (this overrides the file name, so use short file names if you want) and `title`[<sup id="2q6wtE">â†“</sup>](#f-2q6wtE) sets the title that is displayed to the reader. The `authors`[<sup id="1ghDVK">â†“</sup>](#f-1ghDVK) are defined in `ðŸ“„ changelog/authors.yml` and tags are comma-separated and created on-the-fly.

<br/>

Right under the anchor markup, we can import components that we need (in this case we're using Tabs in [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions)), but almost any component that is useful in a static generated site will work.

Then, we ultimately mix our components with Github flavored Markdown (NB, it has issues with some of the advanced commonmark features, but works fine for GH style Markdown).

â¬œ 15     Along, with detailed documentation, videos and tutorials, you'll find detailed 
â¬œ 16     release notes for every Swimm Release, as well as news about our other tools, such
â¬œ 17     as our [IDE Plugins](/docs/ide-integrations/ide-plugins) or [Github App](/docs/continuous-integration/github-app).

â¬œ 25     Swimm generally releases at the beginning of every week, so you can expect updates
â¬œ 26     to be pretty low volume. There will also be a note if new tutorials are added, or
â¬œ 27     any other features that impact the functionality of this site. Major new features
```

<br/>

For posts that **do** have images and assets, create a directory similarly to how we set up the automatic changelog entries, and place whatever media is necessary within that folder. To the reader, there is no difference between any of these approaches.
