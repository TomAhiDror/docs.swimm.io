All of the documentation that lives in the side bar can be found in `ðŸ“„ docs` . The main landing page for that section is `ðŸ“„ docs/index.mdx` , which is what you see if you navigate to `/docs` directly on the site. There's also a nav link to go right to the documentation without first viewing the quick start.

Documents have a special table at the top that determines their slug, title, and sort order for display. Let's take a quick look at what's going on in `ðŸ“„ docs/authorization` , starting with \[\[sym:./docs/authorization/_category_.json(1dc1f99f-d5fb-47f4-9cea-efd7b6bdf811)\]\]

<br/>

The JSON file determines where the _category_ should be displayed (in which order) as well as set the name for the category.

### ðŸ“„ docs/authorization/_category_.json
```json
â¬œ 1      {
ðŸŸ© 2          "label": "Signup & Authorization",
ðŸŸ© 3          "position": 5
â¬œ 4      }
```

<br/>

The markup at the top of the file determines the slug, and the sort order within the category itself. Docusaurus will override anything in the `id`[<sup id="pO1Kg">â†“</sup>](#f-pO1Kg) value here with the contents of the first H1 tag in the document, if it exists.

### ðŸ“„ docs/authorization/index.mdx
```mdx
ðŸŸ© 2      id: Signup & Authorization
ðŸŸ© 3      slug: permissions
ðŸŸ© 4      sidebar_position: 0
â¬œ 5      ---
```

The explanation for how React components work in [Managing Blog Posts & The Changelog](managing-blog-posts-the-changelog.axB2v.sw.md) applies here too - you can use whatever components make sense for a statically-generated site.

For top-level documents above any of the sections, the sort orders will be used, with the categories always coming last.
