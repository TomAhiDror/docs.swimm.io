The [FAQ](https://docs.swimm.io/faq) is a static MDX page that uses React components with simple markdown. The headings are generated as HTML when the site is compiled, which is what powers the right-side table of contents. The sections themselves are generated by the `📄 src/components/FrequentQuestions.js` component, which is a wrapper for the [react-faq](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-faq-component) component. The styles for the page come from Docusaurus, the styles for the collapsable FAQ entries are found in `📄 src/components/FrequentQuestions.module.css`

<br/>

Below is how the page is generated. We let Docusaurus control the headings and then render the entries in the client. `FrequentQuestions`[<sup id="2qN73e">↓</sup>](#f-2qN73e) is the component that is called with the argument that correlates to an index in the `FAQIndex`[<sup id="1ERVNs">↓</sup>](#f-1ERVNs) object.

### 📄 src/pages/faq.mdx
```mdx
⬜ 8      
⬜ 9      <p>&nbsp;</p>
⬜ 10     
🟩 11     ## 🪪 Signing Up & Permission Scope
🟩 12     
🟩 13     Additional information about Swimm's security profile can be found <a href="/security/">here</a>
🟩 14     <FrequentQuestions Category="SignUpAndPermissions" />
⬜ 15     <p>&nbsp;</p>
⬜ 16     
⬜ 17     ## 🔐 Security & Privacy
```

<br/>

This is what actually wraps the FAQ component and injects our entries. Notice that **there is no type checking or default category** (TODO: Fix that, I just needed something that works).
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 src/components/FrequentQuestions.js
```javascript
⬜ 607        }
⬜ 608    };
⬜ 609    
🟩 610    export default function FrequentQuestions({Category, Index=FAQIndex}) {
🟩 611        var data = Index[Category];
🟩 612        return (
🟩 613        <div>
🟩 614                <Faq
🟩 615                    data={data}
🟩 616                    styles={styles}
🟩 617                    config={config}
🟩 618                />
🟩 619                <br />
🟩 620            </div>
🟩 621        );
🟩 622    }
```

<br/>

And this is an example entry. Each part of the page corresponds to an index in this object. Note that the first-level `title`[<sup id="H2X5x">↓</sup>](#f-H2X5x) is intentionally left empty, this is because we want Docusaurus generating the headings along with the automatic table of contents, not the component.

Each row is then defined in order. To add another section:

*   add the heading and call to `FrequentQuestions`[<sup id="Zum2IS">↓</sup>](#f-Zum2IS) matching the other sections in `📄 src/pages/faq.mdx`
    
*   create an index for it in `FAQIndex`[<sup id="1ERVNs">↓</sup>](#f-1ERVNs)

⬜ 33                             Simply navigate to another repo and select the docs you'd like to add. 
```

<br/>

That's it! You can do all of this while the dev environment is running and see it load on the screen as soon as you save the files.
