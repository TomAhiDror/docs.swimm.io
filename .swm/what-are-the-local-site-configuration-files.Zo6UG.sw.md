We have three main configuration files that you need to know about:

1.  `📄 docusaurus.config.js` which is the main Docusaurus configuration.
    
2.  `📄 swimm.config.js` which holds Swimm-related config items for things that aren't components of Docusaurus.
    
3.  `📄 releases.config.json` which holds metadata about all Swimm releases (or, it soon will)
    

## The Docusaurus Config

The Docusaurus config is fairly well commented. The only other thing to be aware if is that it's guarded - you can't add values it's not expecting.

<br/>

If you want to add anything to the global config, you have to add it as a child of `customFields`[<sup id="1b4Gb8">↓</sup>](#f-1b4Gb8). There aren't many cases where this would be optimal, most Swimm-specific stuff should go in `📄 swimm.config.js` .
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 docusaurus.config.js
```javascript
⬜ 14       organizationName: 'swimmio', // Usually your GitHub org/user name.
⬜ 15       projectName: 'docs.swimm.io', // Usually your repo name.
⬜ 16       titleDelimiter: '🏊',
🟩 17       customFields: {},
⬜ 18       presets: [
⬜ 19         [
⬜ 20           '@docusaurus/preset-classic',
```

<br/>

You can also define scripts that will be put in the head of every page.

### 📄 docusaurus.config.js

⬜ 50           }),
⬜ 51         ],
⬜ 52       ],
🟩 53       // see https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config#scripts
🟩 54       scripts: 
🟩 55       [
🟩 56         {
🟩 57           src:
🟩 58             '/js/tags.js',
🟩 59             async: false,
🟩 60         }
🟩 61       ],
⬜ 62       plugins: [
⬜ 63         [
⬜ 64           require.resolve("@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local"),
```

## The Swimm Config

This config can store whatever needs to be kept track of. Use the functions in `📄 src/components/SwimmUtils.js` to get to it:

<br/>

After you import the SwimmUtils component, you can call `Swimm`[<sup id="Z1bdEdk">↓</sup>](#f-Z1bdEdk) with an argument to get the configuration object that you need. For instance, `Swimm('version')` would return an object with information about the current version.
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### 📄 src/components/SwimmUtils.js
```javascript
⬜ 8      import YouTubePlayer from './YouTubePlayer.js';
⬜ 9      import styles from './SwimmUtils.module.css';
⬜ 10     
🟩 11     function Swimm(props) {
🟩 12         var index = props || 'version';
🟩 13         return SiteSettings[index];
🟩 14     }
⬜ 15     
⬜ 16     Swimm.propTypes = {
⬜ 17         index: PropTypes.string
```

<br/>

The objects in `SiteSettings`[<sup id="28FeRl">↓</sup>](#f-28FeRl) contain what's needed. Add more as needed. Note that `version`[<sup id="Z2cFg3m">↓</sup>](#f-Z2cFg3m) comes from `GetCurrentSwimmRelease`[<sup id="1j2puY">↓</sup>](#f-1j2puY), which comes `📄 releases.config.json`

⬜ 1      import GetCurrentSwimmRelease from './src/components/SwimmVersions.js';
