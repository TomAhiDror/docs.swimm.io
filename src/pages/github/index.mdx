# Swimm Web App - Security Overview

Swimm is a code documentation platform for individuals and teams. With Swimm, developers 
create code-coupled documentation that is saved on their own repository in Markdown format, 
and is kept up-to-date when the code changes.

The Following are several questions and answers regarding our security profile. If you have 
any questions that do not appear here, or if you need clarification, please don’t hesitate 
to contact us at info@swimm.io

**Once you've read this, we recommend <Link to="/docs/quickstart">going through the fifteen minute quickstart</Link>
to get started.**


## Why is Swimm asking me for GitHub OAuth?

Swimm is using it to connect with your GitHub repositories in order to fetch relevant documents 
and verify if code snippets are up-to-date. In addition, Swimm enables users to issue Pull 
Requests to update documentation accordingly. Swimm never makes changes to source code files 
other than documentation files (.sw.md).

### Who can see my code?

Only you, and those who normally have access to it in GitHub. Swimm never makes a copy of your
code, everything is stored in your repository on GitHub.

### How does Swimm store the GitHub token that I provide?

The GitHub token is stored on the client-side browser (local storage) in a manner that is only 
accessible to Swimm’s app. The Token is not stored at any time on Swimm’s servers. 

### Will any of our code or content ever travel to, or be stored on Swimm’s servers?

No. Swimm does store meta-data such as document titles, timestamps, usage statistics etc, but
none of your actual code or content.

### Will Swimm ever make any changes to my code?

Swimm will create a folder in your repo to store the documents you create upon first login to the 
app (`/.swm/`). After that, upon each document creation - once the user stores the document, Swimm 
will save the relevant file in the folder created in your repo. Swimm will not make any modifications 
to your code besides these files and will not change any existing code files. Every operation to the 
code starts with an explicit intent from the user, and the change management is performed on your 
version control system.

### Where are Swimm’s servers?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

### Does Swimm encrypt my data?

All data transferred to and from Swimm’s server will be encrypted during transit. Any data or 
metadata stored on Swimm’s servers will be encrypted at rest.

### Can Swimm affect code in production? 

No, Swimm does not modify any code in your production environment.

## Swimm CI Integration - Information Regarding GitHub App Authorization

Swimm helps its users maintain fresh documentation by integrating into their CI. This can be done 
manually [add link to relevant doc site page] or by using our GitHub App.

Following are several questions and answers regarding the Swimm GitHub App’s security profile. 
Note that these refer only to users of the GitHub App and not to users of our web app that do not 
use the GitHub App. If you have any questions that do not appear here, or if you need clarification, 
please don’t hesitate to contact us at info@swimm.io


### Which permissions does the GitHub App require and why?

Swimm uses read access to read your code and verify that the documents are in sync.

We use “PR comment creation” access to write a comment, identified with “Swimm” on the PR during 
verification.
When we discover documents that get out of sync due to code changes in a PR, we use write access to create a commit on the same PR with the required document changes in order to to automatically sync your documents. Note that Swimm will never apply code or document changes to your repository without user consent. 
We need check permissions (both read and write) to install the GitHub app in your repos and execute the app on demand. Once the app is installed, a user can select to enable/disable the app per repo and make the checks required or not-required per branch.

### Does Swimm store the GitHub token that I provide?
No. Every time an action is triggered, GitHub sends  the unique app installation identifier to Swimm’s 
server. We use this information to generate a unique token (one-off token). This token is never stored 
on our servers and is used for the duration of the action only.

### Will any of our code or content travel to Swimm’s servers? Why?

Yes. During the action operation, the app reads the code to verify that the documentation is up to date. 
We remove the code immediately from our servers after the operation is completed. During this process, 
no one at Swimm has access to your code or to your content. 

**To emphasize - we never store your code on our servers.**

### Will any of our code or content ever be stored on Swimm’s servers?

No.

### Will Swimm ever make any changes to my code?

No. The GitHub App will only indicate to the user whether or not the documents are up to date. The app does
not have any write access permissions to the code itself. 

### Where are Swimm’s servers?

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

### Does Swimm encrypt my data?

All data transferred to Swimm’s server will be encrypted during transit. We use only secure functions (HTTPS) 
to fetch the code from GitHub servers and communicate back the results. 

### Can the Swimm CI app affect code in production? 

No, Swimm does not modify any code in your production environment.
