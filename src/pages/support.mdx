# Getting Help With Swimm

If you encounmter a problem or have a question that isn't covered here, there
are several ways that you can get help.

## Swimm's Community Slack Channel

You don't need a paid Slack account in order to participate and we welcome anyone
that has a question - just come in and ask! You'll be able to interact directly
with other Swimm users, as well as Swimm's developers and product managers.

This is also our preferred way of receiving feature requests and bug reports while
we're still in beta. We love the reports, but we also want to help you fix whatever
problems you may be having.

## Stack Overflow

If you're a Stack Overflow user and feel comfortable asking questions there, we'll
be happy to answer them. Stack Overflow prefers question of a technical, objective
nature and shouldn't be used for discussions, bug reports or feature requests. Those
types of things are welcome in Slack.

Make sure you use the <SwimmLink target="stackOverflowTag"/> to your question, and we 
will see your question in our internal and community Slack channels.
