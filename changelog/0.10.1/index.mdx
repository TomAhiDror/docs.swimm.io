Also, Swimm's code-coupled editor includes being able to view live snippets, Smart Tokens, and use all the features that are currently available in Swimm's web application so that you can switch back and forth from docs to code seamlessly. 

## Improvements:
- **Fresh New Look for Swimm's App** - Check out and explore the new look for Swimm's app. You can navigate to the global menu to search, change your settings, and get notifications. Also, find your workspace docs in one consolidated spot now, including Repo and Cloud Docs. 
- **Committing Docs** - We have improved the performance for committing docs and have added a progress bar.
- **Repo Page Loading** - We have improved the performance for loading repo pages.
