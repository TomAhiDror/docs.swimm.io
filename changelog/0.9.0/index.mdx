# Swimm 0.9.0 Has Been Released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 0.9.0**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

<SwimmReleaseBlogPost version="0.9.0" />

## New Features:
- Introducing our new Slack App to make it easier for you and your team to stay updated with Swimm! With the Swimm Slack app, once you connect your repo to a Slack channel, you will automatically be notified whenever a new doc is merged to your default branch. As an admin, just go to the `Integrations` page and click the `Install` button next to Slack.
- We now support Documents and Playlists list view. You can view more documents in the list view at once with relevant information in each column. You always have the option to switch back to the previous card layout.
- You can now control personalized email, Slack, and in-app notifications when an important action affecting you occurs. The new notifications area can be accessed from `Profile > User Settings > Notifications`.

## Improvements:
- App Facelift: We’ve made changes and improvements to Swimm's app including viewing workspace related stats on the Home Page. Note that all of your documents are still available under `Everything`.
- Removed the `Mark as Read` button from docs. It is still available inside Playlists.
- Improved the Swimm Editor writing flow
  - Every line is draggable
  - Snippets and images can now be inserted everywhere
- Improved pasting of Markdown and HTML content
  - With new shortcuts (`cmd + v` and `cmd + shift + v`)
- Added a contextual menu to each line in the document
- Created new shortcuts moving content up and down (`ctrl + shift + up` and `ctrl + shift + down`)
