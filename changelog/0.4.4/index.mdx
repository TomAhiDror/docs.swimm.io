## Bug Fixes:

 - Fixed issue where repositories weren't visible to all users. 
 - Fixed UX glitch where it was not obvious how to close the support flyout.
 - Fixed issue where some docs had double headers when viewed in playlists.
 - Fixed issue with flickering upon signup (it's now a two-step process).
