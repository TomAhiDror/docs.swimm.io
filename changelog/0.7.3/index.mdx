# Swimm 0.6.4 Has Been Released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 0.6.4**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

<SwimmReleaseBlogPost version="0.6.4" />

<SwimmReleaseVideo version="0.6.4" />

## New Features:

 - Playlist DAC (Docs As Code) improvements & finalizations. Please report any issues!
 - Pre-commit hooks [version 0.7 released](https://github.com/swimmio/pre-commit), now automatically downloads the correct CLI binary and supports opening issues on failure via webhook. 
 - New documentation and developer community site: [docs.swimm.io](https://docs.swimm.io)
 
## Improvements:
 
 - Snippet Studio now allows you to reselect snippets from other files (for cases where the code actually moved to another file).
 - Branch selector menu is now easier to use for those that have many different branches.
 - Automation tools (such as CLI binaries) are now served from Firebase, not Github. This solves intermittent rate-limiting issues.
 - External links in Swimm content now open in a new tab by default.

## Bug Fixes:

 - Fixed an issue where copying smart text resulted in an extraneous '`)`'.
 - Fixed issue with Docker files in smart text causing reference issues.
 - Fixed issue where adding a repo caused all of them to show up as loading.
 - Fixed issue where loading animations stopped while things were still loading.

If you have any questions or issues, please reach out on our <SwimmLink target="slack" />. You can
also drop in during our next <SwimmLink target="officeHours" /> event. We hope to see you there!
