# Swimm 0.9.4 has been released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 0.9.4**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

<SwimmReleaseBlogPost version="0.9.4" />

<SwimmReleaseVideo version="0.9.4" />

## New features:
- **Sharing Doc Drafts**- As an admin, you can now let users share doc drafts with teammates. This ability can be configured on a repository level via the `Integrations & Settings` page. The default setting is the `Local Drafts` . Once an admin selects the Cloud Drafts option, new drafts created by any user will be stored in the cloud for 30 days unless committed before then. Users can share a doc draft by clicking the share icon from the top right corner of the edit doc page and clicking on the `Copy Link` .

- **Doc & Playlist Creation Hub**- Creating new docs has never been easier. Simply click the "New" button on your repo page and see all the options to start creating new documentation.


## Improvements:
- **Viewing and Edit Docs** - When viewing or editing a doc with snippets, the referenced files section displays only filenames without their full path. You can still hover on a filename to see the full path.

- **Adding Tags** - When adding a tag from a specific doc, the list of workspace tags is ordered alphabetically.

## Bug fixes:
- In the GitHub App, when a PR only contains a Swimm doc change without any changes to the code, no Swimm comment will be added to the PR.
