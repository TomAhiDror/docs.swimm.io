# Swimm 1.0.0 has been released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 1.0.0**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

<SwimmReleaseBlogPost version="1.0.0" />

<SwimmReleaseVideo version="1.0.0" />

## Improvements:
- **sw.md Format** - We changed the separation of sw.md information from Smart Tokens, which was causing broken and empty tokens. Now Swimm keeps the text of the token along with its metadata with a ghost HTML tag which is invisible to users but holds all the data needed.
- **Auto-sync** - Auto-sync algorithm improved, improving accuracy on Auto-syncable snippets. 
- **App Sidebar** - Added sidebar across the app for a more robust and stable performance.
- **Creation Hub** - Made changes to Swimm's Creation Hub.
- **Code Snippets** - Added an action to show less context for code snippets. 

## Bug fixes
- Fixed: Editor sidebar no longer collapses when moving between steps.
- Fixed: The status page for the progress bar for repos without documentation.
- Fixed: New workspaces are now created with counters for admins and users.
- Fixed: Clicking links in workspaces no longer invites the user to join the workspace.
- Fixed: Displaying of Smart Paths and Smart Tokens.
- Fixed: Playlists
    - Now shows the step types. 
    - Steps in the progress bar appear as selected when editing Playlist pages.
    - Discarding doc drafts while editing Playlists.
- Fixed: Adding repo button icon.
- Fixed: Auto-sync algorithm no longer takes up too many lines.
- Fixed: Editor function for Smart Tokens
    - Smart Tokens ending with brackets are now saved correctly.
    - Smart Tokens with new lines before them.
