## Improvements:

- **Statistics Tab** - The statistic usage dashboard has been updated. You can now see the total number of docs in your workspace, recently created docs, your workspace's top contributors, and the most read docs, including how many docs were read and where they were consumed. 
- **UI Improvements** - UI improvements including adding icons to the "Paste HTML" & "Paste Markdown" options, the hamburger button popup, and the discard draft icon. 

## Bug fixes
- Fixed: the ability to paste an image into the editor.
- Fixed: navigating steps when editing Playlists.
- Fixed: deleting docs from the home page.
- Fixed: clicking edit on doc requests.
- Fixed: Editor topbar path title of documents.
- Fixed: other minor bugs.
