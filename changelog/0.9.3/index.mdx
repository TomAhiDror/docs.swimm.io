# Swimm 0.9.3 Has Been Released!

We're pleased to announce the availability of **Swimm 0.9.3**<SwimmMoji text="release"/>

<SwimmReleaseBlogPost version="0.9.3" />

<SwimmReleaseVideo version="0.9.3" />

## New Features:
- **Introducing Tags**: You can add tags on each doc and filter your docs by tag in your repos. When a tag is created, it can be used across all of your workspace repositories. You can also rename, remove, or permanently delete a tag from your workspace by going into a doc and then from the sidebar, hover over the tag. Then, click on the "..." menu to manage your options.

- **Coverage Goals for Repos**: Admin can now set a coverage goal for every repo. Check out the new Insights Tab for more repo coverage data and to set your coverage goals.

- **Document Updates Graph**: Admins can now see the number of documents that have been updated with Swimm's patented Auto-sync feature.

## Improvements:
You can now filter documentation by type (docs or Playlists), file name, stage (committed/pending/draft), and tags. 

- **GitHub App**: When the Swimm Verify Check setting is enabled from the GitHub app settings and a PR includes Swimm doc changes, you will receive a different Check message clarifying that related Swimm docs have been updated.

- The `Integrations` page (available to Swimm admins only) was removed. Instead, you can navigate to the new `Integrations & Settings` page (contains the same options) from the Home/Repository page via the left sidebar gear icon or via the gear icon next to the repository name. 

For further information and any questions, please reach out to us on our <SwimmLink target="slack" />.
