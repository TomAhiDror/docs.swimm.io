We've <Link href="https://swimm.io/blog/advanced-documentation-editor-how-to-create-code-coupled-docs-in-seconds/">

how it came to be.

## Swimm Editor Features
Swimm content editor is simlar to other editors you might know but it is designed to facilitates writing documentation.<br/>
**Therefore, it has extra features that enables up-to-date walkthrough documentation.**

## Components are just a `/` away
All of the Swimm Editor features are easily accessed by typing the `/` key. <br/>
This brings up a menu that you can select what you want to include.

As a best practice we recommend grabbing a bunch of code snippets to get started. <br/>
They'll provide a useful start to write the narrative that walks someone through the code.

<br/>
The available commands are:

+ **Path:** a path to a file or a folder
+ **Snippet:** Code Snippets from your repository
+ **Image:** Upload an Image
+ **Doc:** A link to a Swimm Document
+ **Playlist:** A link to a Swimm Playlist
+ **Table:** Create a Table
+ **Giphy**

:::note
Paths and Snippets in a Swimm doc are watched for changes.

## Bring helpful context through the Snippet Studio

It's very easy to bring in code from multiple files together in the same document.
This is useful for teaching someone how different parts of the code
come together when it runs. 

A useful example are client code and stylesheets, referencing how models work
within the controllers that call them, or any other time where you need to teach 
how things fit into the larger picture in addition to how individual functions and
methods work.

## Make documentation people will want to own

When creating documentation, including flow charts and diagrams is helpful for others to
understand what you are trying to describe. Images, videos, and GIFs also makes documentation
easier to consume. This makes it more valuable to people on your team, which hopefully
means everyone will be more inclined to improve it and create even more.
