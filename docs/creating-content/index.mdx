# Creating Content With Swimm

Swimm is a code-coupled documentation platform that is
language-agnostic. In this section, we give you a quick overview of some of the main Swimm features. 

When you sign up for Swimm, you'll create <Link to="/docs/creating-content/workspaces">
Workspaces</Link> for your team as a centralized place to work on your repos.

Next, our <Link to="/docs/creating-content/fluid-editor">Fluid Editor</Link>, 
paired with its <Link to="/docs/creating-content/smart-tokens">Smart Tokens</Link> 
and <Link to="/docs/creating-content/snippet-studio">Snippet Studio</Link>, integrates code tokens and file paths into your documentation so that it remains synced. Swimm's patented <Link href="/docs/publishing-content/autosync">Auto-sync</Link> 
automatically checks any documentation pushed to Git to make sure it's up to date.

Once you've reviewed our Quick Start Guide, we recommend a few quick options for creating your first doc. You can, for example, select a code snippet that needs a tad bit of explanation. Or you can create documentation from a PR from part of the code you'd like to document.

Next you can consider creating a <Link to="/docs/creating-content/playlists">Swimm Playlist</Link> which is a collection of documents, links, videos, Markdown files, and images that you put together to help facilitate understanding your codebase. One common feature is creating an onboarding playlist,
to help new developers joining your team.
