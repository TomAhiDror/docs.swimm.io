# Smart Tokens & Paths

Smart tokens and paths in Swimm help your documentation stay in sync
through refactoring and reorganization. With smart paths, you don't have
to worry about changing file names or even directory structure around, 
Swimm will be able to keep up with it. 

With smart tokens, you'll no longer need to worry about the impact of
refactoring on your documentation, renaming constants or variables or even
class and method names won't cause you to need to update your documentation
everywhere they're mentioned. 

## How do Smart Paths work?

You can insert a smart path in your doucment throught the `/` slash menu in
the editor. Select "Path" and then select a file or directory that you'd like
Swimm to keep track of for you.

As long as you use `git mv` to move things around, Swimm will automatically 
sync the links. The path will appear as a hyperlink in your document that 
allows people to browse the content.

:::tip Use Smart Paths Early To Save Time Later
Sometimes what starts as one project snowballs into writing a library, and a client
to use that library, as well as a bunch of tests. Smart paths let you keep documenting
things as you go without much concern for where they ultimately land in your repo structure.

## How do Smart Tokens work?

Smart tokens are a feature that lets you reference parts of your code even outside of
snippets in a way that automatically updates when the code changes. The most common use
for smart tokens is referencing variable, method or function names within the narrative.

To create one, you first need to add a snippet containing the token you want to track. 
Then, just open a backtick <code>\`</code> and start typing - Swimm will autocomplete based on
code you've referenced.

We're working on making smart tokens not require the presence of a snippet and hope
to have it in testing in the very near future. We understand that sometimes it's 
ideal to just reference the file and the token, rather than bring in a snippet just
for one or two lines.

:::tip Naming Is Hard - Just Write It
It's easy to get caught up in what to name things especially when the scope of what
something will do is stll unclear. With Swimm, you can name it `MysticalDooDad` and
document it as you go, then come up with something more sensible once it settles.

## Do Smart Tokens have the concept of types?

No. Tokens are watched based on the shape and nature of the way they change. While 
you migh think Swimm understands types by the way it syncs a change from something
like `(void **)` to `(mytype_t **)` or strings to integers, it's really just 
tracking the change in context and the token itself. 

While there may theoretically be some limits to this approach, we have yet to hit
them, and the approach lends very well to our language-agnostic design.
