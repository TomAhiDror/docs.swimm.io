# What Are Swimm Workspaces?

You can set up Swimm Workspaces with multiple repositories. At the top of the workspace menu, there's an option to add more workspaces.

If you need help adding a repo, see <Link to="/docs/authorization/connecting-repositories">connecting repositories</Link>.

## How many Workspaces should I have?

We recommend starting with one, and then creating more if necessary. While 
we don't limit them, we'll caution that having too many can become confusing 
when new people need to be invited.

You don't need to be part of a Workspace in order to read the documentation
created within it if you're using our <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/ide-plugins">
IDE plugins</Link>, or publish the markdown outside of Swimm.

## What are some commmon uses for Workspaces?

Some common uses for Workspaces include:

 - Single Workspace, several repositories or just one monorepo. This is the
 most common configurations.
 - Separate Workspaces for separate teams, with some repos being part of 
 multiple Workspaces. This is pretty common among those that work with microservices.
