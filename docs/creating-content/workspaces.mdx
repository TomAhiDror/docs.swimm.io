# What Are Workspaces?

Workspaces are a logical grouping between people on a team and the repositories
that they work on. They're where both repositories and users are introduced and
managed within Swimm. 

## Managing workspace & repositories

The top of the workspace menu slides down to reveal the workspace management 
functionality, and there's a heavy plus below it to add your first repo:

<img alt="Swimm Workspace Management" src={useBaseUrl('/img/workspace-2.png')} />

If you need help adding a repo, see <Link to="/docs/authorization/connecting-repositories">connecting repositories</Link>.

## How many workspaces should I have?

We recommend starting with one, and then creating more if you need them. While 
we don't limit them, we'll caution that having too many can become confusing 
when new people need to be invited.

You don't need to be part of a workspace in order to read the documentation
created within it if you're using our <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/ide-plugins">
IDE plugins</Link>, or publish the markdown outside of Swimm.

## What are some example workspace uses?

The best use is the one that doesn't cause confusion and that people actually
use. They're one component of many in the sea of Swimm (we're hiring, if you 
like puns). However your team naturally comes to use them is probably great!

If you need some inspiration, our clients generally fall into one of these
categories with their use:

 - Single workspace, several repositories or just one monorepo. This is the
 most common configuration.
 - Seperate workspaces for separate teams, with some repos being part of 
 multiple workspaces. This is pretty common among those that work with microservices.
