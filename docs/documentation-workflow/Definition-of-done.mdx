# Definition of Done (DoD)

At Swimm, we include the creation of new documentation in the Definition of Done (DoD), and therefore is a regular part of the development workflow. We've found it to be an efficient, workable, and value-added investment during sprints.  

:::tip
## Ready to think about the creation of new documentation in the DoD?
* Write documentation with Swimm's code-coupled editor
* Consume your docs in the IDE. Swimm has plugins with VS Code and IntelliJ
* Import existing documentation from Confluence and Notion

## What is the Definition of Done?

The Definition of Done is generally viewed as a shared understanding of what work must be completed for a work unit (user story, sprint, feature) to be considered releasable to customers. 

Best practice usually translates the DoD to a series of templates or checklists, each relevant for a different work unit.

## Why the Definition of Done matters

Having a clearly defined Definition of Done is important for many reasons:

1. It provides a baseline for sprint planning. When dev teams know ahead of time what is expected in terms of testing, documentation, and deployments, they can more accurately size backlog items and plan accordingly.
2. It avoids repetitive conversation and redefinition. A clear DoD provides a framework for defining the tasks required for each work unit. So, your dev team can focus on innovation and execution rather than definition.
3. It reduces the need for rework. A clear DoD limits the risk of misunderstanding and conflict among the dev team and product owners. Once a backlog item is accepted as “done,” the chance that it will need to be reworked is reduced, and required (non-critical) updates can be moved into the backlog.

## Who defines the DoD?
Engineering managers are key players in defining “done” because most of what comprises the Definition of Done revolves around technical requirements.

But defining “done” doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It cannot simply focus on building usable software. It must be aligned with the overall organization’s needs, goals, and core values. Therefore, establishing a definition of what qualifies as “done” should ideally be a collaborative process among engineering/dev teams, product, QA, and other relevant stakeholders.

## Should the Definition of Done include developer documentation? 
Even considering the huge advantages of developer documentation, the truth is that most software development organizations will likely not feel they’re ready yet to prioritize developer documentation to include it in the DoD. Understandably, developers are concerned that the documentation investment is just too great, that their dev team won’t embrace it, or that it would result in a DoD that is too involved and unworkable, potentially slowing velocity.

But let’s remember: it wasn’t too long ago we were having the same conversation about whether end-to-end testing should be included in the DoD, and exactly the same concerns were raised then. It hasn’t taken long, though, for us to recognize that writing tests sooner rather than later has provided great value and allowed us to make significant-quality advances. *And as a result, end-to-end testing has become part of the DoD in many if not most companies*.

So while many companies don’t yet feel ready to enforce a policy of developer documentation as part of the DoD, we know that more and more companies are moving in this direction.
