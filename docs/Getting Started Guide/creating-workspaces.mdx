We suggest that you begin setting your Swimm workspace right away.

You can set up Swimm Workspaces with multiple repositories. At the top of the workspace menu, there's an option to add more workspaces.

**How many workspaces should I have?**

Every organization is different and it depends on your needs. Ususally organizations choose to create workspaces for their teams or by products.

For your team, it may be an AI workspace, or an infrastructure team. 
If you have multiple products in your company, it makes sense to have multiple workspaces.
