# Swimm's IDE Plugins
IDE Integrated documentation is the most convenient method of creating and reviewing documentation. With Swimm’s IDE plugins, developers read and write documentation inside their IDE and no longer have to switch contexts to an external place to write documentation.

Swimm supports integrations with all JetBrains and Visual Studio Code IDEs.

### Why using Swimm the IDE plugins?
- Read all available docs right in your IDE.
- Discover existing documentation in your codebase.
- Review annotations easily when reviewing or writing new code.
- Eliminate context switching and the alt + tab nightmare.
