# Swimm's IDE Plugins
Swimm allows you to creat code-coupled up-to-date docmentation without the hurdles and issues that common documentation tools have.
And if you are just getting started with documentation, you can import into swimm existing documentation or use some of the advanced templating.<br/>

Now that you have some documentation, the best way to access it is **in context**, **in time**.<br/>
With our IDE plugins, you can view your documentation where you need it, when you need it!

### Why using Swimm the IDE plugins?
- Discover documentation linked to your code.
- Browse all the available docs right from the IDE.

Swimm supports **VSCode** or any of the **JetBrains family**.
