# Swimm's IDE Plugins

Swimm's IDE plugins allow you to see links to Swimm documentation right from
the code that they document. When you click on a link, your IDE will open a 
new tab with the documentation perfectly rendered from Markdown. You can then
kick off a split window, and read the documentation side-by-side with the 
code you're working on. 

:::tip Would you like to try Swimm directly from your IDE right now, in about a minute?

You can experience Swimm documentation inline with code ***right now*** with VSCode or 
any JetBrains IDE - it will only take a minute with three easy steps. **No signup of
any kind or sharing of information is required.**

<Tabs

        {label: '3. Experience Swimm!', value: 'three'},

        <Link href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17201-swimm">JetBrains</Link> plugin as appropriate. 
        Take a look at the screen shots below to get an idea of what it adds and how it surfaces Swimm documentation.</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="two">
        <p>Clone this site from its <Link href="https://github.com/swimmio/docs.swimm.io">public Github repo</Link>. This
        is a Docusaurus site powered by Typescript, React and MDX, that is actively and continuously documented with Swimm!</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="three">
        <p>Open the repo in your IDE and click on the Swimm plugin icon. You'll see a list of files that have documentation 
        associated with them. Click on any file and look for the Swimm links, which will render the corresponding document 
        in a new IDE tab.</p>

Here's how Swimm documents are advertised within the IDE - take this state
machine transition table as an example:

<img alt="Swimm Visual Studio Code Plugin Showing Swimm Doc Link" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_1.png')} />

Links appear *per snippet* that you include in your documentation, so the more
snippets, the better the in-IDE coverage is going to be. Continuing the example,
let's say someone was looking for clues about that state machine in the header:

<img alt="Swimm Visual Studio Code Plugin Showing Swimm Doc Link" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_2.png')} />

What's even more special is the ability to read the in-depth doc, right there in
the IDE, by just clicking on one of those Swimm doc links:

<img alt="Swimm Visual Studio Code Plugin Showing Whole Doc In Tab" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ide-plugins_3.png')} />
