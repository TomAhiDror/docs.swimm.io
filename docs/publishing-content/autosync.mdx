# What is Swimm's auto-sync?

There are approximately <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages">
700 non-esoteric programming languages</Link> in the wild that someone could conceivably use. But,
even esoteric or purely educational code needs documentation, so imagine that number being at least
one thousand very conservatively.

Swimm's auto-sync algorithm makes informed decisions about what happened in your code based on the
impact that any given change made to the code. This approach is much faster, much more accurate and
exponentially more efficient than requiring a full-blown lexical parser for well over a thousand
languages.

## What kinds of things can Swimm automatically sync?

It's difficult to provie an exhaustive answer to this. Rather, it's helpful to contemplate the
footprint that any change to the code might leave:

 - You implemented a new method or function, so code that follows below it likely shifted down
 a bit.
 - You added or removed a line that was there to help with debugging. 
 - You renamed a variable, or changed function or method arguments
 - You used Git to rename a file or directory
 - You added a type cast to resolve warnings about an ambiguous callback

These are all great examples of trivial changes that all have a very similar "shape" to them,
almost completely regardless of the language being used. 

Additionally, when you use <Link to="/docs/creating-content/smart-tokens">Smart Tokens & Paths</Link>
to teach Swimm about tokens it should keep an eye on, you allow Swimm to not only sync your
code snippets, but also other mentions of these tokens throughout your documentation.

## Does Swimm have any concept of types?

No. Swimm doesn't understand the *implications* of your change since it's not interpreting
your code, it's examining the totality of the shape of the change that you introduced. 

If you change:

```c
int main(void) {
    unsigned int i;
}
```

To this:

```c
int main(void) {
    unsigned long i;
}
```

... Swimm is going to understand it and automatically update the snippet, because the code
appears to still represent the same thing. If you introduce a change in the code that raises
a potential type safety issue, you'll need to make sure to note that in the narrative around
the code. 

## What about preprocessors or Oxygen-style markup?

Swimm only understands one scope, which is the entire file. It doesn't understand conditional
compilation, execution scope, variable scope, comments, or other comment markup. 

It's on our roadmap to be able to input documentation from other formats easily into Swimm
documentation, but understanding comment markup would be a job the editor does, similarly to 
how it interprets markdown.

## What happens if auto-sync can't handle something?

Sometimes code vanishes completely, or changes into something that's just unrecognizeable from
what it was. If auto-sync decides that a change is impactful enough that human oversight is needed, the
following things happen:

 - The running verification check will fail. Depending on your configuration, this means
 it will block the commit or pull request until the issue is fixed, or it will open an 
 issue that needs to be resolved within a certain timeframe.
 - Any affected documentation will be marked as potentially out-of-date, including any
 exported (confluence, notion, etc) documentation if you automate updating them
 from your builds.

The *worst* case becomes documentation that lets people know that certain parts are 
potentially out-of-date, which is still a marked improvement over letting folks find out
that documentation was out-of-date the hard way.
