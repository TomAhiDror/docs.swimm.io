# Publishing Swimm Documentation

The most thorough code documentation in the entire world isn't going to do
anyone any good unless people on your team know it exists, can conveniently 
consume it, and most importantly, trust it. 

Because it uses Markdown on the back-end, Swimm documentation is extremely 
portable and easily transoformed into other formats. That's why we suggest
that the primary way of reading Swimm documentation is through the use of 
our <Link to="/docs/ide-integrations/ide-plugins">IDE plugins</Link>, where
you see Swimm Docs linked right in the code they explain, and the
documentation opens right in your IDE. 

And with <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/autosync">
Swimm's patented Auto-sync</Link> feature along with <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/third-party">
support for third-party documentation stores like Notion & Confluence</Link>, 
Swimm automatically checks any documentation pushed to Git to make sure it's up to date. And, in fact, if the code in your documentation has changed, Swimm alerts you to address the issue. This way, your code and documentation are always both accurate and up to date. 

We've also got a great tutorial on <Link href="https://github.com/swimmio/docusaurus-template#readme">
how to publish your Swimm documentation with Docusaurus</Link>, which is the same
engine that powers this documentation site.
