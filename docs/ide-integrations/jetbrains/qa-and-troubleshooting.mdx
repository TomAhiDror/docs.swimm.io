# Troubleshooting 

**Why do I need to register to Swimm?**<br/>
In order to start using Swimm, you will need a Swimm account with at least one workspace. Note that your repositories need to be associated with a workspace, and Swimm stores minimal metadata about your repositories. 

## Troubleshooting and Error messages:
Errors you may encoutner, after logging in.<br/>
:::caution Login Error
**“Swimm repository not detected”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository doesn’t have any Swimm docs and has never been connected to your Swimm workspace.
:::

Or <br/>
:::caution Login Error
**“Cannot retrieve the workspace or repo information”**<br/>
Or **“You are not a member of a workspace where [repo name] is connected to.”**<br/>
Meaning: The repository is not connected to a Swimm workspace or you are not a member of a workspace where this repository is connected to.
:::

**In case of all the errors listed above, make sure that:**
1. **Your organization is registered and has a Swimm workspace.**

    If not, create one - it’s free.
2. **You are a member of that workspace.**

    If not, request from your administrator, to join the workspace.
3. **The repository you are working on has been added to the workspace.**

    If not, login to the workspace and “add a repo” to your workspace.
4. **You have editing GitHub permissions to that repository.**

    If not, request your administrator to provide you with such.
5. **You are logged in to Swimm in the IDE.**


## Supported scenarios
**Single repo**

- Opening a single repo from VS Code is the most straightforward way.

**Sibling multi-repo**

- Opening a folder with multiple same-level repositories. This is also supported by Swimm. Swimm’s welcome panel will detect the active repo and all the information will be relative to it.

**Nested repositories**

- Nested repositories (such as SubModules) are not a supported pattern.
