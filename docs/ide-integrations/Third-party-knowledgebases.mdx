# Third-party Knowledgebases

Swimm's markdown (`.swm.md`) is easily shared to your internal wikis or knowledgebases. 

If the back-end supports markdown, it can be as simple as pasting Swimmâ€™s markdownfiles into the right place. You can automate this process (for example by writing a script) to copy the files or upload them to whatever publishing software you are using. 

## Working with Swimm files
You can create two types of assets in Swimm: Repo Docs and Cloud Docs

**Repo Docs** are code-coupled documents that are saved in the repository in a markdown format. All the content that you and your team create under Repo Docs is saved under the ./swm folder in the root folder.

**Cloud Docs** are not code coupled and they are saved in Swimm database. To export Cloud Docs please contact support@swimm.io 

## Things to keep in mind with all integrations

We want Swimm to be as frictionless as possible in all ways that you use it. We want your documentation to be easy to read because it was easy to create, easy to keep up to date and easy to publish. 

That said, we want to keep Swimm's format as portable and easy to incorporate into your existing systems as possible, so we try to make this easy as we can to accomplish with existing tools. 

No matter which way you go, you'll likely need to do the following things:

 1. Never work on the original .sw.md files. Make sure to have a copy.
 
 2. At the bottom of every `.sw.md` file is a line that looks like this:
   ```HTML
    <!-- THIS IS AN AUTOGENERATED SECTION. DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION DIRECTLY -->
    ### Swimm Note
    ```

3. Tools like <Link href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</Link> can be used to convert your Swimm
content to HTML, MediaWiki / JiraWiki, TeX formats, DocBook and many many more. <Link href="https://asciidoc-py.github.io/">AsciiDoc</Link> 
is another great open source option for converting between formats. 


If you have a question about a
particular one, or one that isn't listed, head to our <Link href="https://swimm.io/slack">Community 
Slack channel</Link> and we'll help you out. 

### Docusaurus

Swimm maintains a <Link href="https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction#docs-only-mode">docs only mode</Link>
template for Docusaurus. <Link href="https://github.com/swimmio/docusaurus-template">Just fork this repo</Link> and
follow the instructions in the README. You'll have a site complete with an offline search that you can deploy to
any host that supports node apps.

### Stack Overflow For Teams & Stack Overflow Enterprise

Export the `.swm.md` to <Link href="http://commonmark.org/">Commonmark</Link> with Pandoc, and you can use it 
on both Teams & Enterprise.  Automation will be feasible if the corresponding APIs allow read/write access. Currently, both are read-only. 

### Jira Wiki (All)

Cloud and on-premises documentation centers using <Link href="https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/WikiRendererHelpAction.jspa?section=all">Jira Wiki Formatting</Link>
should use Pandoc to convert from `.swm.md` to Jira Wiki. Then check with your IT / DevOps /
SRE team to figure out what your automation options might look like. 

### MediaWiki / Generic Wiki

Use Pandoc to convert to the closest markup flavor (MediaWiki is generally good for most of them),
and then paste/update the content. This can be automated in many ways; while MediaWiki has a <Link href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API">very easy RESTful API</Link>.
You can also just update the database.
