To get started with Swimm, we suggest running through this Quick Start Guide we've created.  

Bring documentation to your team to make knowledge sharing faster, easier, and coupled to code.

## Add a Repository


Once your workspace is set up, connect your GitHub repository.

**Step 1: Click "Connect a Repo" from the sidebar.**

## Create your first doc


**If you're asking yourself, "Where do I start?" here are a few quick tips.**

On the documentation front, starting small is absolutely fine! 

:arrow_right: Select a **Code Snippet** and write notes to walk another developer through the code

:arrow_right: Review Draft Documentation from your **Pull Requests** that Swimm creates automatically for you

:arrow_right: Use one of **Swimm's Templates** to help you get a documentation jump start

 All docs will be saved under the .swm folder once the docs are committed to the repo.
