**Step 4:** Search and then select the repository you plan to document. Once you’ve selected your repo, you can get started creating or reviewing documentation. 

If you don't see the repository you wish to add, Swimm doesn't have the correct <Link href="/security">permissions required</Link> and you’ll need to click the `Manage Scope` button at the bottom of the dialog box.

## How to change the order of repositories

You can change the order of repositories displayed on the left-side navigation. Hover over any repository and drag the repository using the new 8-pin icon. 

Note that changing the order of your repositories only affects your Swimm account and not other members' accounts.
