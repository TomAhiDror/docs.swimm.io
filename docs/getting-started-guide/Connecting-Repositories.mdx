**Step 4:** Search and then select the repository you plan to document. Once you’ve selected your repo, you can get started creating or reviewing documentation. 

If you don't see the repository you wish to add, Swimm doesn't have the correct <Link href="/security">permissions required</Link> and you’ll need to click the “Manage Scope” button at the bottom of the dialog box.
