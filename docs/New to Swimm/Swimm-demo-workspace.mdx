Swimm created a public view-only demo workspace to serve as a quick introduction to Swimm’s platform.

The workspace is Sentry’s Public repository so you’ll be able to see how Sentry’s engineering team has been using Swimm to create their documentation. We hope that this will help you get inspired to jump in and explore Swimm.

## How to use Swimm’s demo workspace## 

The best way to use Swimm’s demo workspace is to just begin exploring different docs and Playlists as an example of how you might plan to create your own workspace. Swimm’s demo workspace is a view-only space; you cannot create and edit docs. 

As you’re exploring, be sure to check out different docs and Playlists on the repo page. As you open these docs, you’ll notice Swimm features include live code snippets, Smart Paths, and Smart Tokens.

When you’re ready to navigate to your own workspace, simply click “Go to My Workspace” on the blue banner on the top of your screen.
