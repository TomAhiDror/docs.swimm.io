# Swimm's GitHub App

The Swimm GitHub app verifies that all your documents are up-to-date on every PR. 
When a Doc requires reviewing, we post a comment with a link to 
editing this specific Doc. 

Have team members who don't know Swimm yet? Our app posts comments to make sure 
they know what to do when their documents need review.

If you're using GithHub, our app is very likely the integration you want to use.
It'll always use the latest and greatest underlying verification code that our
GitHub Action uses, with a lot of additional polish to help streamline PRs and
the whole review process. 

Anyone that has administrative access to your GitHub organization can install
the GitHub app easily through the "Integrations" page.
