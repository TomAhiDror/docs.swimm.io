# Verification through commit hooks

Commit hooks are a neat feature of Git (and other DVCS) that allow you to 'tap into'
certain functionality at certain stages of operation. One of the most useful places
for hooks to run is *right* before finalizing a commit.

Commit hooks are very useful for running lint scripts, static analysis and anything
else that commonly causes pull requests to be rejected due to housekeeping. Swimm's
verification checks can effectively run here, but this will only be effective if
**everyone** uses the hooks the same way.

To utilize pre-commit hooks, You'll need to make sure you have the latest `swimm_cli`
executable somewhere. **The `swimm_cli` executable should be invoked from the root
of the repository you wish to verify**. 

You can run this code to install it to `/home/yourname/bin` for instance:

```shell
wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
chmod +x ./swimm_cli
```
We recommend always fetching a new copy of `swimm_cli` in your scripts so that your
verification is the same engine as the latest Swimm release.

## Sample commit hook configurations:

Below are the sample configurations, in no specific order. If you need one that
isn't listed, please reach out on our <SwimmLink target="slack" />

### Husky

Add the following to your `package.json` file:

```js
// package.json
{
 "scripts": {
   "pre-commit": "swimm_cli verify"
 }
}
```

Then, run the following in your terminal while in the repository root:

```shell
// run in terminal
$ npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run pre-commit"
```

### Pre-commit

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commmit.com) works with Git to intercept certain kinds of events 
through the use of hooks, which allows actions to run before the commit transaction actually 
takes place. Swimm's CI tools are just as useful if run pre-commit as they are if run through 
a CI server - the main difference is the check runs on your local machine _before_ the commit 
actually takes place, and not as a part of the push / PR / review cycle.

The result is the same, failed documentation checks can trigger other things to happen, or even 
block the commit, depending on the conventions that feel right for you and your team.

To install pre-commit hooks, first install pre-commit, and then follow the instructions 
[in this repository](https://github.com/swimmio/pre-commit). 

### Shell example: verifying docs are up-to-date

```shell
echo "Verifying docs"
wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
chmod +x ./swimm_cli  
./swimm_cli verify
``` 
### Shell example: verify overall coverage

`swimm_cli coverage` Will scan whatever code Git knows about and compare that to
the amount of documentation you've created. The result will be a score of 0 to 100. 
To get that number, try the following command:

```shell
swimm_cli coverage | grep "/" | awk '{print $4}'
```

Expect a float (as in 0.00 or 89.73). If you need a whole number (0 - 100), run this instead:

```shell
swimm_cli coverage | grep "/" | awk '{print $4}' | cut -d. -f1
```
