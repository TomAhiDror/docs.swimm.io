# What Is Continuous Documentation?

<Link href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/continuous-documentation/">Continuous Documentation</Link> is the 
guiding philosophy behind all of the components that make up Swimm. In the modern age, for documentation to
remain relevant, it must integrate continuously with the code that it supports. For Swimm to enable this, it 
needs to understand when the documentation you've written is out-of-date.

## When is documentation considered continuous?

:::tip We Consider Documentation Continuous If It Meets The Following Criteria:

<Tabs
    defaultValue="coupled"
    values={[
        {label: 'Code-coupled', value: 'coupled'},
        {label: 'Up-to-date', value: 'current'},
        {label: 'Written When Best', value: 'fresh'},
    ]}>
    <TabItem value="coupled">
        <p><b>This means documentation that explicitly references parts of the code.</b></p>
        <p>For example, including code snippets, names of functions or variables, file paths 
        and other explicit reference to the code, within the documents.</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="current">
        <p>Continuously verifying documentation means making sure that the current state 
        of the documentation matches the current state of the codebase, as the code evolves.</p>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="fresh">
        <p>Continuously creating documentation means that documentation is written not
        as an aftermath, but when it makes sense.</p>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

The best way to achieve this is by running Swimm's verification checks within your existing continuous 
integration workflow, or building a continuous integration workflow with Swimm if you don't currently 
use a CI server. If you can't adopt a CI server, it can be accomplished through <Link href="/docs/continuous-integration/commit-hooks">commit hooks</Link>.
