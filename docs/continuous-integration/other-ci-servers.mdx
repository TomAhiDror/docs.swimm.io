# Manual Integrations

If you're using GitHub, we **strongly** encourage you to <Link to="https://github.com/apps/swimm-io">install our GitHub app.</Link> This
will provide the best possible experience for everyone involved from the originator of the PR all the way to the reviewer.

For all other CI servers the process is almost exactly the same:

 1. Make sure git is present and configured (`user.name` and `user.email` **must** be set.)
 2. Download the latest 64 bit dynamically-linked executable with `curl` (Node is no longer needed)
 3. Make the download executable
 4. Return the result of  `swimm_cli verify`, which is nonzero on failure

:::warning Make sure you don't use 'shallow' pulls

Shallow pulls are where only part of the history is fetched. This can save a few
seconds of time for projects that have extremely long histories, but it can trigger
false alarms for Swimm when it can't reconcile specific changes in the code. 

:::

Below are tested example configurations that you can use as-is, or as a starting
point for your own configuration:

### Github Actions 

```yml
name: Swimm
on: pull_request
jobs:
  Verify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # pulling the commits history is required for the verification to function properly
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - uses: swimmio/swimm-verify-action@v1
```

### Bitbucket Pipelines

```yml
image: ubuntu:latest
pipelines:
  default:
    - parallel:
        - step:
            name: Documentation
            script:
              - echo "Verifying documentation units"
              - wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
              - chmod +x ./swimm_cli
              - ./swimm_cli verify
```

### Travis CI

```yml
- wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
- chmod +x ./swimm_cli
- ./swimm_cli verify
```

### Gitlab

```yml
# Adopted from the community contributed base node image, found at:
# https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Nodejs.gitlab-ci.yml
image: ubuntu:latest
# We deliberately do not cache anything
test_async:
 script:
   - echo "Verifying documentation units"
   - wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
   - chmod +x ./swimm_cli
   - ./swimm_cli verify
```

### Azure DevOps Pipelines

Note that Microsoft no longer grants free parallel tasks to new Azure DevOps users; this was done in response to some folks abusing the build servers. Hence, you'll need to have been given a grant to continue using parallel jobs for free, or you need to be on a paid account. 

Below is the YAML to configure the pipeline:

```yml
# Pipeline config to verify Swimm docs as in-sync
# Copyright 2021 Swimm
# License: MIT

trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:

- bash: |
    echo "Verifying documentation units"
    git config --global user.name "Username" 
    git config --global user.email "me@example.com"
    wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
    chmod +x ./swimm_cli  
    ./swimm_cli verify
  displayName: "Swimm Verify" 
```

### Circle CI

```yml
# Use the latest 2.1 version of CircleCI pipeline process engine. 
# See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference
version: 2.1
jobs:
  swimm-verify:  
    docker:
      - image: cimg/ubuntu:latest
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: |
            git config --global user.name "Pretend User"
            git config --global user.email "pretend@example.com"
            wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cli
            node swimm_cli --version  
            node swimm_cli verify
workflows:
  sample: 
    jobs:
      - swimm-verify
```

Ordinarily, your `workflows:` section will already be defined, just put `- swimm-verify` under one of the defined jobs, where you want it to run.

### Jenkins

The best way to run on Jenkins is through a "Freestyle Project", formerly known as a "Workflow". 
You can set up a project called "Swimm Verification" and point it at your repository, with 
whatever triggers or timing you'd like. There are only a few things that you have to watch out for:


 1. You absolutely, positively must have Node JS installed on the worker, version 14 or later. If you're on a Debian-ish setup, [here's a really good tutorial on how to install the Node LTS package](https://tecadmin.net/install-latest-nodejs-npm-on-debian/). The gist is, add the official Node repo to your sources via `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo bash -` - and then just `apt-get install nodejs` -- this will work even if you have an older version installed (e.g. Node 10)

 2. If you are using Jenkins' advanced clone configuration, _make sure you disable the shallow pull option_ - Swimm is going to require that the entire history be present.

 3. You're going to need `wget` or `curl` installed, which you can do via `apt-get install wget`/`apt-get install curl`
 
Once you have that done, under Build, select "Execute Shell" and paste the following commands:

```shell
echo "Verifying documentation"
git config --global user.name "user.name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@domain.com"
wget -O swimm_cli https://releases.swimm.io/ci/latest/packed-swimm-linux-cl
chmod +x ./swimm_cli
./swimm_cli --version
./swimm_cli verify
```
