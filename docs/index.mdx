# Welcome to Swimm
## What is Swimm
Swimm is a documentation tool designed for engineering teams to meet documentation challenges. <br/>
Swimm enables developers to create documentation that is:
Code-coupled
- Always **up to date**
- **Easily** Created
- Consumed **when and where** needed  

## Why Swimm 
Many companies have given up on documentation. At Swimm, we often hear:

> “Our docs become obsolete very quickly.”<br/>
> “We just don’t have time for documentation.”<br/>
> “Documentation is too hard to create.”<br/>
> “Developers don’t like to write.” or “The last thing developers want to do is write documentation.”<br/>
> “It’s too much work to maintain and update docs.”<br/>

:::info Why Swimm?
The connection between good documentation and higher developer productivity is now well established (<Link to="https://octoverse.github.com/">GitHub's Octoverse study</Link>). 
At Swimm, we get that **developer documentation is a game changer for companies**.

## Swimm's Approach
Swimm's entire solution is built for engineering teams by engineers. <br/>
We treat documentation like code (Docs-as-code) to streamline the process so that documentation and code are created and maintained together. Swimm saves all documentation as code so that your docs are easy to read as Markdown files.<br/>
Swimm has many **integrations** with other tools. **Compass**. **VS Code**. **IntelliJ**. **Slack**. More to come.

## How Swimm is Different
**Auto-sync**<br/>
With “Auto-sync,” documentation is always up to date. One of Swimm’s core unique capabilities with Swimm’s patented Auto-sync feature is ensuring that your documentation will stay synced with the code as it evolves and changes.

**Code-coupled editor**<br/>
Swimm’s code-coupled editor. Swimm created the world's first editor with all the capabilities of rich text, Markdown, and live code snippets embedded in your docs.

**In your IDE**<br/>
Consume documentation directly from the IDE. Accessing documentation at the right time means that you have it exactly when you need it. You’ll no longer need to switch contexts from the IDE and an external location for your docs.

**Asisstance  Guidance**<br/>
Swimm helps developers actually write documentation. We totally get that writing documentation is not most developers’ forte. If you’re not sure where to start or prefer more assistance in writing a doc or notes, you can use Swimm’s Guided Doc Creation wizard and templates to help get a doc written in just a few minutes. 

**Documentation coverage**<br/>
Understand the bigger picture of your documentation coverage. Once you get started with documentation, you’ll know which parts of your codebase have documentation coverage and how to set up documentation coverage priorities and goals for your teams.
