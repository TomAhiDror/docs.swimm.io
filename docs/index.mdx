# Welcome to Swimm

## What is Swimm

Swimm is a documentation tool designed for engineering teams to meet documentation challenges.<br/>

Swimm enables developers to create documentation that is:

- Code-coupled
- Always **up to date**
- **Easily** created
- Consumed **when and where** needed

## Why Swimm

Many companies have given up on documentation, saying things like:

> “Our docs quickly become obsolete.”<br/>
> “We just don't have time for documentation.”<br/>
> “Documentation is too hard to create.”<br/>
> “Developers don't like to write” or “The last thing developers want to do is write documentation.”<br/>
> “It's too much work to maintain and update docs.”

We know documentation is broken. That's why we're here to fix it.

:::info
Why Swimm? The connection between good documentation and higher developer productivity is now well established (<Link to="https://octoverse.github.com/">GitHub's Octoverse study</Link>). At Swimm, we have seen firsthand that **developer documentation is really a game changer for companies**.

## Swimm's approach

Swimm's entire solution is built for engineering teams by engineers.<br/>

We treat documentation like code (Docs as code) to streamline the process so that documentation and code are created and maintained together. Swimm saves all documentation as code so that your docs are easy to read as Markdown files.<br/>

Swimm has **many integrations** with other tools: **VS Code**, **IntelliJ**, **Slack** and more to come.

## How Swimm is different

If you are asking what are the Swimm differentiators - _what makes Swimm different_ - here's your answer:

**Swimm's patented Auto-sync feature**<br/>
With “Auto-sync,” documentation is always up to date. One of Swimm’s core unique capabilities with Auto-sync is ensuring that your documentation will stay synced with the code as it evolves and changes.

**Our code-coupled editor**<br/>
Swimm created the world's first editor with all the capabilities of rich text, Markdown, and live code snippets embedded in your docs.

**IDE integrations**<br/>
With Swimm, you will consume documentation directly from the IDE. Accessing documentation at the right time means that you have it exactly when you need it. You’ll no longer need to switch contexts from the IDE and an external location for your docs.
