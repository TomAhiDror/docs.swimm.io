# What Permissions Are Required?

Swimm requires both read and write permissions on our platform. In this document, we explain more about why these permissions are required. 

:::tip We Never Store Your Code On Our servers

We have a special <Link to="/github">security FAQ for GitHub </Link>that answers many questions about
how things are stored and transmitted. Your code and snippets aren't stored 
on our servers; Swimm just needs permission to read files, analyze changes,
and write the content you create to the `.swm/` directory. 

:::

## Organizational permissions

Since most repository hosting 
services are tied to your *personal* log-in, you'll need to tell Swimm specifically
which organization owns the repos you'll be working on. This will allow you 
to grant Swimm individual repo permissions within that
organization.

## Read permissions

In order to be able to select code snippets within the <Link to="/docs/creating-content/snippet-studio">
Snippet Studio</Link>, Swimm will need to be able to read the repository.

Swimm also needs access to the entire commit history in order to be able to understand
and account for code changes. This is what enables Swimm's <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/autosync">
Auto-sync</Link> algorithm to automatically process 
changes to your code, automatically syncing <Link to="/docs/creating-content/smart-tokens">
Smart Paths & Smart Tokens</Link>. Your code remains in your repo, and Swimm simply stores metadata about snippets, paths
and tokens so that it can remember what it's supposed to keep track of.

## Write permissions

Swimm uses a special directory named `.swm/` in your
repo to store your documentation along with a unique identifier that 
correlates your documentation to your repository.

Swimm needs to be able to write when you create or update a document, and when it
detects changes that can be automatically synchronized.

Swimm will also dynamically create branches and open Pull Requests as needed when
it encounters protected branches.
