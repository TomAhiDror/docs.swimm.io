# What Permissions Are Required?

Swimm requires both read and write permissions in order to be able to function 
properly. While repository hosting can vary from provider to provider, they
all have concepts of organizational permissions, and permissions for each 
repository. We'll explain what Swimm needs, and how we use that permission.

:::tip We Never Store Your Code On Our servers

We have a special <Link to="/github">security FAQ for Github </Link>that answers many questions about
how things are stored and transmitted. Your code and snippets aren't stored 
on our servers; Swimm just needs permission to read files, analyze changes
and write the content you create to the `.swm/` directory. 

:::

## Organizational permissions

Swimm needs to have access to whatever organizations own the repositories that
you's like to use Swimm in order to document. Since most repository hosting 
services are tied to your *personal* log-in, you'll have to tell Swimm specifically
which organization owns the repositories you'll be working on. This will allow you 
to grant Swimm individual repository permissions on repositories within that
organization.

## Read permissions

In order to be able to select code snippets within the <Link to="/docs/creating-content/snippet-studio">
Snippet Studio</Link>, Swimm will need to be able to read from the repository.

Swimm also needs access to the entire commit history in order to be able to Understand
and account for code changes. This is what enables Swimm's <Link to="/docs/publishing-content/autosync">
Autosync</Link> algorithm to automatically handle many kinds of non-substantive 
changes to your code, automatically sync <Link to="/docs/creating-content/smart-tokens">
Smart Paths & Smart Tokens</Link>. 

Your code remains in your repository, Swimm simply stores metadata about snippets, paths
and tokens so that it can remember what it's supposed to keep track of.

## Write permissions

Swimm uses a special directory (a directory named `.swm/`) in your
repository to store your documentation along with a unique identifier that 
correlates your documentation to your repository.

Swimm needs to be able to write when you create or update a document, and when it
detects changes that can be automatically synchronized.

Swimm will also dynamically create branches and open pull reuqests as needed when
it encounters protected branches.
