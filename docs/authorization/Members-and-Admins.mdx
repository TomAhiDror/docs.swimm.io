# Members and admins

There are currently two types of users at Swimm: Members and Admins    

**Members can**:
Create, edit, collaborate, and assign documentation, Playlists & diagrams, create workspaces, and connect to the Slack app.  

**Admins have all the capabilities of Members plus the following. They can:** 

1. Connect repositories to workspaces.
2. Install Swimm's GitHub app to automate workflows to promote documentation creation and consumption.
3. Allow publishing docs from a repo to the Cloud, so that even when users don't have access to the repo, they will still be able to view those docs. Published docs are kept in sync with Swimm's GitHub App.
4. Track and learn about member activity in a workspace, including daily sessions and number of docs read.
5. Track coverage and see documentation recommendations to increase coverage where it is needed.
6. See the number of documents that have been updated with Auto-sync.
