# Discovering and Reading Documentation

### Cloud Docs

Cloud Docs are stored in the Cloud so that anyone in your workspace can view these docs, even if they don’t have access to your repo.

Since Cloud Docs are not connected to your code, they are useful for both developers and other members of your team for storing knowledge about processes, methodologies, or other non-technical documents.

### How do Cloud Docs work?

Cloud Docs are stored in the Cloud so that anyone in your workspace can view these docs, even if they don’t have access to your repo. 

You can also publish Repo Docs to the Cloud so that anyone from your workspace can review them - even if they don't have access to your repo.

Since Cloud Docs are not connected to your code, they are useful for both developers and other members of your team for storing knowledge about processes, methodologies, or other non-technical documents.

You don’t have to authorize your Swimm account with GitHub in order to create Cloud Docs. To start working on a Cloud Doc, click on “Cloud Docs” from the left sidebar, then click “New.” Your Cloud Doc will be automatically created and saved as soon as you save it and give it a title, or after you start entering text below the title.

### Are Cloud Docs private?
Cloud Docs are private by default. This means that initially only you can view your newly created Cloud Docs. To change sharing settings for a Cloud Doc, click on “Private” from the top right corner of the doc, and select the “Workspace” option. You can decide to switch back to “Private” mode.

At this point, Cloud Docs that are shared on the workspace level can only be edited by the creator of the doc. In addition, it is not possible to add code-coupled snippets, Smart Paths, or Smart Tokens to a Cloud Doc.

Note that on the “Everything” page, only Workspace level Cloud Docs are displayed - not private Cloud Docs.
