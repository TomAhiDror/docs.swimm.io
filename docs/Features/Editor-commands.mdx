Swimm’s slash editor commands are a great way to quickly create and edit content in your documents.

To use these commands, type `/` at any line and you will see the commands menu.

To pick a command, start typing its name followed by “Enter” or just click on it.

**Important Swimm commands:**

- `Path`\- Add a path of a directory or a file in your document. Swimm will track it in case it is renamed, moved, or deleted.
- `Doc` - Add a link to an existing Swimm doc. Swimm will track it in case it is getting out of date and notify.
- `Playlist` - Add a link to an existing Playlist. Swimm will track it and notify you if it’s out of date.
- `Code` `Snippet` - Add live code to your document with code snippets.
- `Diagram`\- Add a code-coupled diagram.

## Add your first code snippet

Type `Code` and select to add a code snippet. Our Snippet Studio will show up.

<br />

Snippet Studio provides you with an easy way to locate a file and select a certain section from it. Once you have selected the code section, click “Add & Exit” (or press “Enter”).

<br />

This will add the code snippet to your document.

Above the snippet, you will see an area to describe and write about the snippet. This part does not need to be long. Best to just describe what the snippet does.

## Add Smart Tokens

Smart Tokens help you keep your documentation up to date by allowing you to reference parts of your code even outside of snippets in a way that automatically updates when the code changes.

The most common use for Smart Tokens is referencing variable, method, or function names within the document.
