# Doc Sharing, Editing, and Collaboration

## Mentions in docs

You can mention specific Swimm users in a doc by typing `/mention` and selecting a user or or by entering @ followed by the user’s name.

All mentioned users inside a doc will appear on the right sidebar for added visibility.

## Sharing doc drafts with your team

You can share a doc draft with your teammates in order to get it reviewed, via Cloud Drafts.
To make this possible, an admin in your workspace needs to enable a setting from the Integrations & Settings popup available via the left sidebar after hovering over the desired repo.

Users can share a doc draft by clicking the share icon from the top right corner of the edit doc page and clicking on `Copy Link`.

The default setting is Local Drafts. A Cloud Draft will remain in the Cloud for up to 30 days. A local version of a draft will still be available after the cloud draft expires unless the draft was already committed.

## Assigning docs
You can ask your teammates to review or update a particular doc or just share it as an FYI. This is possible with the “Assign” feature in Swimm located on the right sidebar. You can assign a doc to multiple users at the same time. 

You can choose from a predefined set of reasons (needs review, needs updating, FYI, other) and assign it and include an optional note. After assigning a doc, the assignees will receive a notification along with the assignment details. 

You can see all assignments for a particular doc (your assignments will appear first) by hovering over the `Assignees` label. 

Assignments assigned to you will contain a “Mark as Complete” icon, which when clicked will mark the assignment as completed, and the assigner will automatically receive a notification in such case telling them the assignment was successfully completed. 

Alternatively, if the assignment is no longer relevant, the assignee or assigner of an assignment can remove the assignment by clicking the delete icon.

## Requesting docs

You can ask your teammates to create a new doc by using the Doc Requests feature.
This feature is available by going to a specific repository in Swimm, clicking the “New” button, and selecting “Request a Doc”. You can see a list of all doc requests by clicking the “Doc Requests” tab. Note that doc requests are visible to all users with access to the Swimm repo.

By creating a doc request, you should explain what type of doc you need by writing what the name of the doc should be (a name that informs your teammate on what should be documented) and by entering a description that will help your teammate better understand your request.

Once you’ve assigned a request to a teammate, they will be notified by email. 

A doc request will automatically be marked as completed once you've merged its associated doc to the default branch. Note, that this requires installing the Swimm GitHub App.

## Thanking your team for a doc

With Swimm you can send a quick thank you to anybody who contributes to creating a doc you've benefited from. 

Here's how: At the bottom of the document, there are 3 options you can pick: **great doc, time-saver, and valuable insights.** 

You can assign a doc to a Swimm user or email address via the Assign link located below the document title. You can choose from a predefined set of reasons (needs review, needs updating, FYI, other) and assign it and include an optional note. After assigning a doc, the assignee will receive an email with the assignment details.

You can see a list of all contributors on a doc (not only the last contributor) when viewing a doc. 


## Documentation Tags

You can add documentation tags on your docs or doc drafts. 

Tags are saved in the doc when the draft is committed, and you can filter your docs by tag in your repos.
When a tag is created, it can be used across all of your workspace repositories. 

You can manage your tags (add, remove or rename) tags on any of your docs directly from within the Home Page, Everything Page, or from within a specific repository.
When adding a tag from a specific doc, the list of workspace tags is ordered alphabetically. 


## Continuous Publish
Admins can allow publishing docs from a repo to the Cloud, so that even when users don't have access to the repo, they will still be able to view those docs. 

Published docs are kept in sync with Swimm's GitHub App.


## Notification Center

At the top area of your screen, you’ll see there is a notification area to edit your docs. 
When there is a new notification, there will be a red dot over the bell.

Under Notifications, you’ll see the following:
1. The notification will be white if you’ve clicked on it
2. The notification will be blue if you have not clicked on it yet
3. When you have a new notification, you’ll see that it’s blue with a red dot. This will let you know that it’s the first time you’ve seen the notification. Once you close the notification, the red dot disappears.

### Get Swimm Notifications in Slack

Swimm plugs right into Slack, and makes it easier for you and your team to stay updated with documentation-related notifications. 

An `Integrations` tab is available inside `User Settings` to install IDE plugins and to connect to Slack in order to receive personal Swimm notifications. Once you connect your repo to a Slack channel, you will automatically be notified whenever a new doc is merged to your default branch. As an admin, just go to the `Integrations` page and click the `Install` button next to Slack.

You can control personalized email, Slack, and in-app notifications when an important action affecting you occurs. The new notifications area can be accessed from Profile > User Settings > Notifications.


## Doc sidebar 

All of the meta information for your documentation can be found in the right-hand sidebar. The doc sidebar is available when both editing and viewing docs.

**The doc sidebar includes the following:**

- Table of Contents - Located on the right side of your screen, the Table of Contents shows referenced files and general doc metadata such as the doc creation date and date last updated. Click on the Table of Contents entry to navigate to a specific section in the doc. When scrolling through a doc that contains headers, the Table of Contents section in the sidebar automatically points to the active doc content.
- General information about the doc (doc creation date, last updated etc)
- Review Auto-sync (with repo docs)
- The doc’s referenced files (with repo docs)
