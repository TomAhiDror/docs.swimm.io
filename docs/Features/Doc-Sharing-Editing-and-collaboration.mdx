All mentioned users inside a doc will appear on the right sidebar for added visibility.


## Documentation Tags

You can add documentation tags on your docs or doc drafts. 

Tags are saved in the doc when the draft is committed, and you can filter your docs by tag in your repos.
When a tag is created, it can be used across all of your workspace repositories. 

You can manage your tags (add, remove or rename) tags on any of your docs directly from within the Home Page, Everything Page, or from within a specific repository.
When adding a tag from a specific doc, the list of workspace tags is ordered alphabetically. 


### Get Swimm Notifications in Slack

Swimm plugs right into Slack, and makes it easier for you and your team to stay updated with documentation-related notifications. 

An `Integrations` tab is available inside `User Settings` to install IDE plugins and to connect to Slack in order to receive personal Swimm notifications. Once you connect your repo to a Slack channel, you will automatically be notified whenever a new doc is merged to your default branch. As an admin, just go to the `Integrations` page and click the `Install` button next to Slack.

You can control personalized email, Slack, and in-app notifications when an important action affecting you occurs. The new notifications area can be accessed from Profile > User Settings > Notifications.


## Doc sidebar 

All of the meta information for your documentation can be found in the right-hand sidebar. The doc sidebar is available when both editing and viewing docs.

**The doc sidebar includes the following:**

- Table of Contents - Located on the right side of your screen, the Table of Contents shows referenced files and general doc metadata such as the doc creation date and date last updated. Click on the Table of Contents entry to navigate to a specific section in the doc. When scrolling through a doc that contains headers, the Table of Contents section in the sidebar automatically points to the active doc content.
- General information about the doc (doc creation date, last updated etc)
- Review Auto-sync (with repo docs)
- The doc’s referenced files (with repo docs)
