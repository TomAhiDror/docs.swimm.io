# Local dev environment

## Doc use case: local dev environment

### Why should you write this doc?

The first thing a new developer should do is to install the local development environment. This is the only sure way to learn the code, to know what to ask and to start contributing.
Being able to configure the dev env by yourself help with the feeling of efficacy. If installing the env is cumbersome and time consuming it will create a (sometimes wrong) feeling that the project is not well implemented.
Sometimes a simple guide can help install even the most complex integrations. (it just needs to be up to date…)


## How should you write the doc? What should you prepare?

### Alternative titles
- Setting up your environment
- Installing the development environment
- Getting started
- Installation instructions

### Divide the doc into sections per operating system
- If the sections are too long divide them into different docs.
- Different OS sometimes use different libraries and configurations.

### Break the tension
Developers are used to complex environments. Meaning, they have seen environments that take 10 minutes to run locally and others that take a couple of days.

Understandably, developers may be tense not knowing what to expect. It is always better to be transparent about what is a going to happen. So if the system is complex, just let them know. Similarly, if it’s easy, let them know that too. 

You can certainly relax them by assuring them that this doc is there to help!

### Create a list of prerequisites

Create a list of system requirements and prerequisites. Be sure the developer understands it makes no sense to advance further before completing this stage.

### Get the sources

We recommend creating project folders in the same place for all developers which will help them assist each other. Keep an up-to-date list of all the repositories that need to be cloned with a short description for each explaining the purpose of the repository.

If the order of cloning and installation is important, be sure to make that clear.

### Installing dev dependencies

For each dependency, create a section with the title “installing X” and another section “setup X." Include step-by-step instructions without skipping any steps. For non-trivial steps, include the reason they are there. It’s very common that developers skips some steps because the purpose of a step was not clear to them.

### Environment variables
Forgetting to configure an environment variable can sometime cause untraceable errors. It is important to make sure that all of the required variables are configured as it is hard to understand that directly from the code.

### Tokens and secrets
If needed, guide the developer to the right place in order to generate their secrets and tokens

### Explain the build scripts
Go over the important scripts and explain what they do. Explain what the devs are going to use all the time, and what they'll only use seldomly.

### Run the environment
Make sure other required services are up and running.

### Wrap-up making a change and seeing it locally

By changing something small in the code and seeing the results, we know that the system is up and running.

For a new developer, it is usually hard to choose the change that will make sure everything is in place. Adding a small task that checks that will help them know they are ready to take the next challenge.

### Other tools

It is easier if all of the devs are using the same tools but sometimes we decide to let go and allow the developers to choose their own.
Make sure the developer understands which tools are mandatory to use and with tools are just a recommendation and it’s up to the developer’s choice.

## What should be in the doc?
**Fast Track Doc:**

### Prerequisites / system dependencies
- Make sure the developer have the right permissions
- Make sure all of the required software is installed
- Make sure if there is missing knowledge they need to have in order to begin

## Cloning instructions
- What are the relevant repositories to clone (in case of microservices and such) 
- Sometimes it is as easy as `git clone` but there are cases where we use submodules or other git libraries.

## Non default configuration
In some cases we use different configuration than the library’s default (in some cases it is OS dependant), let the developer know what is out of the box and what needs additional configuration. 

### Running the build
- What is required, and how to run the build.

### Troubleshooting
Installation never goes smoothly. In this section, list the problems that happened to other developers and include their solutions.
