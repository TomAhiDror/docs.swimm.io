# Template: Code-Coupled Documentation Use Cases

## Why code-coupled docs? 

1. Code-Coupled documentation takes readers on a guided tour of the codebase, using code snippets, tokens & paths to explain points of interest on the codebase map. 

2. Code-coupled docs point out recurring patterns, or describe interactions between different blocks of code that may reside quite far from each other or even in multiple repositories. <br/>
