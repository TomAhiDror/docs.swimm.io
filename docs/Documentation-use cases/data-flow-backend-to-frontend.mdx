# Data flow backend to frontend

## Doc use case: data flow backend to frontend

### Why should you write this doc?
Modern systems often manipulate data. Data is transferred from one component to another. Data initialized by a user’s intention, sent from a frontend component to the store, can then perhaps trigger a backend function by sending a request, and the response can then be processed by yet another function.

Some code parts, even crucial parts, can be hard to understand since they entail various areas of the code that interact with one another in a way that is not necessarily obvious. 

- Imagine a very simple web app, where to fully understand the flow, one would need to go back and forth between various parts of the frontend as well as the backend. 
- Imagine a document explaining how the interaction between various code areas can drastically ease onboarding and clarify the constituents and interactions involved. This will be especially useful for someone who is new to the project.

Many times, data is manipulated at every step of the process, and developers need to know these steps and what happens in each one to understand the state of the data, and what each step expects to receive. 

## How should you write the doc? What should you prepare?

- Go through your code, and trace the data as it flows back and forth between the different components. 

- If there are flows that are actually a recurring pattern, look for one that is simple yet covers the whole story. 

For example, if you explain the flow of an API request going from the frontend to the backend, find one example that shows this interaction clearly without too many specific details.

## What should be in the doc?
**Fast track doc:**

1. The document should consist of snippets, following chronologically the “lifecycle” of the data as it passes through various parts of the system.
2. On each step, describe what is happening to the data, and how it is transferred to the next step - is this a REST request? Is it via some sort of IPC? 
3. If a specific step makes assumptions about the data (for example, assuming it has been validated by a previous step), mention this explicitly.
4. Consider including a test - showing how to test such flows, and what’s important to notice in such cases.
