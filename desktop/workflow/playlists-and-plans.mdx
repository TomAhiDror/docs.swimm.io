# Swimm Playlists

Swimm Playlists are a collection of Swimm documents, images, videos
markdown files and links that are used to have someone progress
through the collection in a defined order. 

An analogy for playlists would be, well, playlists. Think of them 
similarly to how people share lists of songs to play in order. 

To the left is your list of things to do in order, to the right you'll
see what it represents (a doc, a text file, a link or an embedded video).

## Creating & Editing Playlists

To create a playlist, click "New Playlist" from the repository view.

You click the plus on the left to add steps and select the things to 
include. Toggle between "Docs" and "Links" to select the type you want.

## Working through playlists

Open Swimm to the playlist that you want, and just go down the list. At the 
bottom of every step you'll see an option to mark it done. Don't worry if
you need to stop before finishing, Swimm will remember where you left off. 

Workspace admins can see who has marked documents or playlists as complete.
