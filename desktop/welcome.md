# Swimm's Desktop App Documentation

**If you're using the Web App, [you want to head over here](/docs).**

:::tip Make sure you upgrade to `.swm.md` format!

Swimm now saves all documentation as code (DAC), which means your Swimm docs are now as
easy to read as Markdown! However, you have to enable the new format in order to take
advantage of it.

We urge everyone to upgrade now, in order to prevent compatibility problems in future releases.

**Please follow [this very short tutorial](tutorials/Upgrading-swmd) (it only takes a minute!).**

:::

Hello, and welcome to Swimm! We're glad you're here and we're here to help you get the most out of using Swimm to keep your documentation up-to-date and in lock-step sync with your code. Swimm is a rapidly-evolving tool, so we recommend checking back here weekly with each new release. If you're not already in our private beta program and wish to join, [you can sign up here](https://swimm.io/sign-beta). There aren't any sales calls, we just need to give you a guided tour of Swimm because some parts are still a little rough around the edges.

## Your First Laps Around The Pool

Before you do anything else, we recommend that you do the following things (don't worry, they won't take long!):

 - Join our friendly, low-volume [Slack community](https://swimm.io/slack). This is a great resource to get help from other Swimmers, lifeguards, and folks that work at Swimm.
 - Install one of our [IDE plugins](Workflow/IDE%20Plugins) to enable showing beacons where Swimm documentation exists that can be used to open Swimm and jump right into that area of your documentation. Right now, we support VSCode with other popular IDEs in the works.
 - Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/swimm_io) and / or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/swimm-io/) for updates and special opportunities to connect with us. 

At Swimm, we believe that [documentation should be continuous](https://www.infoq.com/articles/continuous-documentation/), be narrated in a way that makes it easy to read, and to accomplish that, it must also be easy to produce and be kept up-to-date. Swimm is a rapidly-evolving product that is driven by the desire to make the whole process of documentation as frictionless as possible; we very much value *any* feedback that you have, features that you'd like to see, and letting your colleagues and friends know about the product! [There are multiple ways to reach us, so please don't hesitate!](Getting%20Help/Getting%20Support)

We've done our best to put any information one might need for day-to-day use in this documentation portal, but this is only one way that we're here to support you - if you find yourself struggling, please reach out to us at any time and we'll make sure you get the help that you need.
